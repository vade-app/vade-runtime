# subscribe-pr-mergeable: poll a GitHub PR's mergeable state; emit one
# stdout line per transition (MERGEABLE <-> CONFLICTING; final MERGED /
# CLOSED).
#
# Closes the gap that `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity` doesn't fill:
# GitHub does not emit a webhook event when `mergeable_state` transitions
# from clean to dirty (base-branch motion turns an open PR into a merge
# conflict), so the existing subscription can't surface it. This script
# polls instead. Sibling to subscribe-discussion.sh.
#
# Suitable for the `Monitor` tool: each printed line is one event
# notification, flushed. Exits 0 once the PR enters a terminal state
# (MERGED or CLOSED), since the subscription is naturally over.
#
# Usage:
#   subscribe-pr-mergeable.sh <owner/repo> <pr-number> [poll_seconds]
#
# Defaults: poll every 120s. `mergeable` lags base-branch pushes by
# ~30s; tighter polling mostly observes UNKNOWN transients.
#
# State: per-PR last-known state file under
# ${VADE_CLOUD_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.vade-cloud-state}/pr-mergeable-watch/
# records the last-emitted mergeable value. First run records the
# current state silently (no event emitted) and only future
# transitions surface.
#
# UNKNOWN handling: `mergeable` reports UNKNOWN transiently while GitHub
# recomputes after a push. Transitions through UNKNOWN are not emitted;
# only transitions between concrete states (MERGEABLE <-> CONFLICTING)
# fire events. UNKNOWN is recorded internally so a subsequent
# concrete-value read can be compared against the last concrete state,
# not against UNKNOWN.
#
# Authentication: relies on GITHUB_MCP_PAT or GH_TOKEN being set.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM) or terminal state (MERGED/CLOSED)
#   1  missing GitHub token
#   2  argument error

Usage: subscribe-pr-mergeable.sh <owner/repo> <pr-number> [poll_seconds]

Poll a GitHub PR's mergeable state; emit one stdout line per
transition, suitable for `Monitor` tail-streaming.

Arguments:
  <owner/repo>     Target repository (e.g. vade-app/vade-coo-memory)
  <pr-number>      Pull request number
  [poll_seconds]   Polling interval, default 120

Environment:
  GITHUB_MCP_PAT        GitHub PAT (preferred)
  GH_TOKEN              Fallback if MCP PAT unset
  VADE_CLOUD_STATE_DIR  State directory root (defaults to ~/.vade-cloud-state)

Examples:
  subscribe-pr-mergeable.sh vade-app/vade-coo-memory 734
  subscribe-pr-mergeable.sh vade-app/vade-runtime 254 60
