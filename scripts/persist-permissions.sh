# Wired as a Stop hook so every turn-end checks for new permission
# decisions and persists them. Idempotent: when no new entries are
# present in local-not-in-shared, exits silently.
#
# Skips auto-commit on main/master (or detached HEAD); writes
# settings.json regardless and surfaces a notice. Append-only:
# does not remove from .local.json (ephemeral) and does not delete
# from shared.allow when local has the same pattern in deny — in
# practice the runtime prompt only writes to .allow, so the conflict
# case is theoretical.
#
# Flags:
#   --dry-run   compute and print delta; do not write, commit, or push.
