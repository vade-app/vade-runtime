# vade-coo git shim — intercepts `git push` and routes through
# git-push-with-fallback.sh so the cloud git-proxy 403 wraparound
# (vade-runtime#67) is the default behavior, not an opt-in.
#
# Installed by coo-bootstrap.sh as a symlink at <bindir>/git, where
# bindir is _snapshot_user_bindir (typically /home/user/.local/bin on
# cloud, ${HOME}/.local/bin on Mac). PATH already prepends that bindir,
# so this shim shadows the system git.
#
# Behavior:
#   - First arg "push" → exec git-push-with-fallback.sh with the rest.
#   - Anything else (status, fetch, commit, push with global flags
#     before the subcommand, etc.) → exec system git directly.
#   - VADE_GIT_SHIM_BYPASS=1 in env → unconditionally exec system git.
#     The shim itself sets this on its own subprocess so the wrapper's
#     internal `git push` / `git remote get-url` / etc. don't recurse.
#
# Removal:
#   rm "$(command -v git)" if it points to this shim, or unset PATH
#   prepend in your shell. The shim is fail-soft — if the wrapper or
#   readlink misbehaves, all paths fall through to system git.
