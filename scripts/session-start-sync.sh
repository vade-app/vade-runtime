# Defensive re-sync on every SessionStart.
#
# Snapshots go stale: the committed repo advances, but the
# baked-in <workspace>/.claude/settings.json and workspace-scope symlinks
# reflect whatever was in vade-runtime at build time. This script closes
# that gap by re-running the idempotent pieces of cloud-setup.sh /
# local-setup.sh that don't need 1Password access:
#
#   1. sync_claude_config  — mirror vade-runtime/.claude into the
#      workspace .claude (preserves the env block populated by
#      coo-bootstrap so MCPs still pick up credentials).
#   2. ensure_workspace_mcp_config — workspace .mcp.json symlink.
#   3. ensure_workspace_identity_link — workspace CLAUDE.md symlink so
#      the harness memory loader auto-reads vade-coo-memory's identity.
#
# Target is $WORKSPACE_ROOT/.claude (the parent of vade-runtime). On
# cloud that resolves to $HOME (/home/user); on local it resolves to
# $DEV_DIR/vade-app, leaving the user's personal $HOME/.claude alone.
#
# Runs first in the SessionStart:startup hook chain (before
# coo-bootstrap) so all later hooks see the freshest hook list and
# symlinks. The sync itself still runs after MCP resolution, so new
# MCPs from a repo update only become visible from session N+1. That's
# the fundamental Phase-B constraint, not something we can close here.
#
# Safe to re-run any number of times; exits 0 on every path.
