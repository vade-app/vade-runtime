#
# Detach discipline (vade-runtime#181/#182, 2026-04-30):
# Under CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 (PR #177 / commit 9f706d7,
# 2026-04-29 03:23 UTC) the harness kills the SessionEnd hook process
# group before the Python export can finish — caught a 48-hour outage
# (R2 has zero objects from 2026-04-29 onward; eight parallel COO
# play-afternoon sessions of 2026-04-29 lost permanently). Foreground
# `exec` did not survive the kill.
#
# Fix: fork the Python via `setsid -f` into a new process session so
# the wrapper can return 0 quickly and the export survives the harness
# killing the SessionEnd hook process group.
#
# Wait-with-detach (vade-runtime#198, 2026-05-03):
# `setsid -f` detach survives signal-based PG teardown but cannot
# survive PID-namespace destruction when a hosted Claude Code container
# terminates shortly after SessionEnd returns. 2026-05-02 saw 0/7
# hosted sessions export to R2 — the export pipeline takes ~5–10s
# (boto3 import, redact, encrypt, op-read, R2 PutObject, meta.json
# auto-commit) and the container outlived <1s of that. Same
# diagnostic shape as #181 (no <id>.export-error.txt drops because
# SIGKILL fires before signal handlers).
#
# This wrapper now block-waits for the detached child up to
# VADE_TRANSCRIPT_EXPORT_BUDGET_SEC (default 20s), holding the
# SessionEnd hook open so the container's grace window covers the
# export. Properties:
#   - agent-teams local: harness PG-kills the wrapper; child survives
#     via setsid -f (#182 behavior preserved).
#   - hosted with grace window: wrapper waits, child completes, clean
#     R2 export. ~5–10s user-visible session-end pause.
#   - hosted with immediate teardown: no worse than today.
#
# The Python script's own contract — always exit 0, drop
# <id>.export-error.txt on internal failure — is preserved.
#
# The fail-open contract holds: env-sourcing failure is non-fatal;
# the Python script handles missing R2/age creds by writing
# export-error.txt rather than raising.
