# memo-index (thin wrapper).
#
# The real memo-index logic lives at
# vade-coo-memory/.claude/_lib/memo-index.sh — it travels with the
# data it operates on (per the data-ownership rule from the 2026-04-25
# emancipation refactor; see MEMO 2026-04-25-02).
#
# This thin wrapper exists so the SessionStart hook chain (which dispatches
# `bash "$HOME/.claude/vade-hooks/dispatch.sh" memo-index` and resolves
# scripts under vade-runtime/scripts/) continues to find a `memo-index.sh`
# entry point. It walks up to find vade-coo-memory adjacent and re-invokes
# the canonical script there.
#
# Graceful: if vade-coo-memory is not adjacent (peer-agent surface, fresh
# vade-runtime clone with no companion), log and exit 0. The hook chain
# does not fail because the index is missing.
