# PreToolUse Bash hook: refuse direct HTTP client subprocess calls to
# `api.github.com`. Forces the agent down the `gh` path, where the
# `gh-coo-wrap.sh` shim auto-routes the correct PAT by repo owner.
#
# Why: When the agent reaches for `curl https://api.github.com/...` it
# bypasses every layer that exists to make GitHub interactions
# anti-fragile: PAT routing, session-URL injection, body-shape lint.
# The 2026-05-11 cross-fork fork failure was the direct cause —
# `gh repo fork venpopov/X` would have routed correctly; `curl ...
# /repos/venpopov/X/forks` did not. This hook converts the wrong
# reflex into a hard refusal at the substrate.
#
# Contract: reads Claude Code's PreToolUse JSON on stdin,
# `{"tool_input": {"command": "..."}}`. Always exits 0. To block, emits
# `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` on stdout. To allow, emits
# nothing.
#
# Block rules (any pipeline stage):
#   - First command word is one of the HTTP-client family:
#       curl, wget, http, https, httpie
#     AND any argument contains `api.github.com`.
#   - First command word is `python`/`python3`/`python2`/`node`/`bun`/
#     `deno`/`ruby`/`perl` AND the next arg is `-c` / `-e` AND the
#     script body contains `api.github.com`.
#
# Allow rules (allowed shapes that mention api.github.com):
#   - `gh ...` (auto-routes via gh-coo-wrap.sh)
#   - File-read / file-edit / grep / sed of a file that happens to
#     contain `api.github.com` (cat, head, tail, less, grep, rg, sed,
#     awk, jq, vim, etc.) — first command word not in the blocked set.
#   - Pipeline whose ONLY mention is in a non-network stage.
#
# Bypass:
#   - VADE_GITHUB_API_GUARD_BYPASS=1 → unconditionally allow. Set this
#     for a deliberate diagnostic; flag in commit / PR if persisted.
#
# Reference: MEMO-2026-05-12-22m9, vade-runtime#TBD.
