#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse Bash hook: refuse bare-echo / bare-printf / cat-EOF of
# token-bearing env vars to stdout/stderr/files.
#
# Why: Claude has at least twice leaked PAT bytes via
# `echo $GITHUB_MCP_PAT`-style commands and self-corrected after the
# fact. The discipline lives in CLAUDE.md but was followed
# inconsistently. This hook refuses the class of command outright,
# converting a soft norm into a hard guard.
#
# Contract: reads Claude Code's PreToolUse JSON on stdin,
# `{"tool_input": {"command": "..."}}`. Always exits 0. To block, emits
# `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` on stdout (per Claude Code
# hook contract). To allow, emits nothing.
#
# Pattern:
#   - Variables guarded: GITHUB_MCP_PAT, GITHUB_TOKEN, MEM0_API_KEY,
#     OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN, AGENTMAIL_API_KEY.
#   - BLOCK if a token-var reference appears as the operand of `echo`,
#     `printf`, or in a here-doc body, AND the redirection (or default
#     stdout) is NOT `/dev/null` AND the output is NOT piped into
#     another command (where the var is the *input* to that command,
#     not its stdout — e.g. `echo "$X" | gh auth login --with-token`
#     is allowed because `gh` consumes it, not the terminal).
#   - ALLOW: existence checks (`[ -n "$VAR" ]`, `[ -z "$VAR" ]`),
#     length checks (`${#VAR}`), redirect to /dev/null, pipe into
#     another command.
#

# Decompose the command into pipeline stages and per-stage logical
# segments split by `&&`, `||`, `;`. We evaluate each segment in
# isolation: a leak in stage 1 is independent of stage 2's behavior.
#
# We work line-by-line on the rewritten command (newlines inserted at
# operator boundaries) so a single `grep -E` per pattern can scan all
# segments. The transformation:
#   1. `|` → newline (pipeline boundary; first stage's stdout is
#      consumed by next stage's stdin, so an `echo $X | gh ...`
#      first-stage emission is not a leak)
#   2. `&&`, `||`, `;`, `\n` → newline (logical boundary)
#
# Then for each segment we test:
#   - If segment matches an `echo`/`printf` of a guarded var AND does
#     NOT redirect to /dev/null AND is NOT followed by a pipe into
#     another command (since pipe was already split out above, the
#     remaining segment is the *terminal* stdout, which IS a leak).
#   - If the segment is a here-doc opener whose body references a
#     guarded var.
#
# Pipe-into-command is handled implicitly: after splitting on `|`,
# only the LAST stage's stdout is "real" stdout. But every preceding
# stage's stdout becomes the next stage's stdin, so an echo-of-var
# in any non-terminal stage is consumed, not leaked. We mark
# non-terminal stages with a sentinel so the check skips them.

# Build a normalized form. We don't try to be a full shell parser —
# we do enough to catch the documented bad cases without false
# positives on the documented good cases.
